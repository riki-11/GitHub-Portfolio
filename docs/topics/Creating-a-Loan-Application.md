# Creating a Loan Application

The fields related to the member's information are required, but their information
will be retrieved when you search for their profile.

> You must [set up the Loan Application Form PDF](Server-Set-up-the-Loan-Application-Form-PDF.md)
> on the server before proceeding, if you haven't already.
