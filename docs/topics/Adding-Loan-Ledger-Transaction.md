# Adding Loan Ledger Transaction

From there, you can pick whether you are encoding a:
- Payment
  - To deduct from your outstanding balance.
- Dues
  - To add from your outstanding balance.
- Balance Readjustment
  - Purely for editing and readjusting the loanee's balance.

Once you are done with the transaction, simply click the __submit__ button to submit it to the database, and it will be instantly reflected to the ledger.
