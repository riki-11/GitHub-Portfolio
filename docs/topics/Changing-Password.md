# Changing Password

Changing a password is a fundamental feature for the security of the website especially considering that the website houses the personal information of the cooperative's members. 

Accordingly, the admin is able to change their own password as well as the passwords of the officers.

The admin is able to change their own password in the dedicated tab.

The passwords of the officers can be changed in the edit officer profile option in the officer profiles tab.

To ensure a secure password, the initial password of a newly created officer profile alongside any new passwords for both the admin and any officer profile will have certain requirements, namely: A capital letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.

Once the password has been changed, upon logging out, the new password will be in effect and will be used to log back in to the specific profile or the admin itself.
