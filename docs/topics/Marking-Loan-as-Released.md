# Marking Loan as Released

When loans are approved from the __Pending Loans__ page, they must be released in order to add transactions. Loans can be seen as released at the __Loan Dashboard__ with a status of ___Approved (For Release)___

To do that, simply navigate to the loan ledger of the loan you wish to ___Mark Loan as Released___. There you will find a ___Mark Loan as Released___ button to the left of the ___Edit Loan___ button. If the ___Mark Loan as Released___ is not present in the page, the loan has already been marked as released.

Pressing the ___Mark Loan as Released___ button will then forward you to a prompt asking if you are sure you want to mark the loan as released. Simply click ___Yes___, and the loan will be released, ready for transactions to be added.
