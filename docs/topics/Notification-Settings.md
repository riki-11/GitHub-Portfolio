# Notification Settings
The notification settings is the page where the admin can edit the highlights on the due dates for the loans. 

There are 5 categories of notifications as seen below:

Editing the notification settings is as simple as changing the numbers and submitting. However, do note that the higher severity notifications must be smaller than the notifications below them. No two notifications can share the same time window nor can a lower severity notification have a smaller number than a higher severity loan.
