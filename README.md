# STADVDB MCO1: Query Processing in a Data Warehouse
This project contains all the files used in our submission for pur STADVDB Major Course Output 1: Query Processing in a Data Warehouse. The dataset used in this project was provided by [SeriousMD](https://seriousmd.com/).


## Project Objectives

1. Build a Data Warehouse - Design the data warehouse following either the Star or the Snowflake schema; Include restructuring of tables and denormalization as needed.

2. Setup an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) Script - to load the data from source to the warehouse. Perform data wrangling tasks, specifically, cleaning, splitting, merging, aggregating, and transforming when necessary.

3. Develop an Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) Application - Design your dashboard to display analytical reports generated using the data from the warehouse by applying OLAP operations, namely roll-up, drill-down, slice and dice.


4. Apply Query Processing and Optimization Strategies - and evaluate their impact on the performance (speed) of the application.


## Preprocessing, Querying, and Data Visualization
1. Python was used to conduct exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing.
2. MySQL was used to conduct all the analytical queries.
3. Tableau was used in conjunction with MySQL for all data visualization and report generation.
